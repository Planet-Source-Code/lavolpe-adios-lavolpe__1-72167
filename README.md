I know this is not truly a programming article. But I wanted to thank all of PSC for your continuous and generous feedback. Even negative feedback is positive when taken as an opportunity to improve weaknesses.

### Source Code

As a regular contributor to this site for the past 9 years, it is time for me to move on and try something else. To all that follow what I post and to those I have corresponded with, I thank you for your support. Over the years many have suggested I start my own site and that is what I plan to do. If things do not work out, I'll be back. Until then... Good luck and good coding to you all.
